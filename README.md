# Data_Science_course_projects
These small projects were realized with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) courses ["Getting started with Python for Data Science"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/getting-started-with-python-for-data-science) and ["Python for Data Science : Working with Data"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python-for-data-science-working-with-data).


## Key Notions

1. Data Manipulation and basics:
    - Using Boolean masks for data filtering
    - Using Python dictionaries
    - Merging multiple datasets using pandas
    - Using control flows
   
2. Data Analysis:
    - Employing pandas calculations for data summarization and computation
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques

3. Data Cleaning:
    - Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis
    - Handling missing data and outliers
    - Utilizing string methods for data cleaning 

4. Python Techniques :
    - List comprehensions for efficient data loading and concatenation
    - Custom methods development for data analysis

## Project 1 : Explore Laptop Repair Data

- summarize the ages of laptops brought in for repair
- determine the most common problems needing repair
- investigate the most common outcomes

## Project 2 : Analyze Electric Vehicles Stations
- use Boolean masks to filter the dataset
- analyze the different kinds of ownership of public-access charging stations, determine which states have the most stations

## Project 3 : Analyze Wage Data
- use string methods to clean the dataset and prepare it for analysis
- use pandas calculations to compute annual wages and compare each occupation to its industry average wage
- use sorting and filtering to understand which occupations are the highest earners

## Project 4 : Analyze an A/B test 
- merge multiple datasets
- perform aggregations

## Project 5 : Analyzing High-Speed Railways
- use list comprehensions to load and concatenate daily railway operation datasets
- use for loops and if/else control flow to clean and prep the data
- analyze the impact of holidays, distance, and weather on railway delays

## Project 6 : Analyze Internet Use
- custom methods
- comparing data within different brackets
